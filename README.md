## Introduction

Link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in a network. In this project, we deal with the problem of predicting whether a research paper cites another research paper. We are given a citation network consisting of several thousands of research papers, along with their abstracts and their list of authors. The pipeline that is typically followed to deal with the problem is similar to the one applied in any classification problem; the goal is to use edge information to learn the parameters of a classifier and then to use the classifier to predict whether two nodes are linked by an edge or not.

## Data

You can download the data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YtvcvyWoQASn0OhQOBVEK10NnZq08Ndz?usp=sharing). It contains information about the edges of the network, as well as the abstracts and authors of the papers. You can also download the embeddings we generated [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BdKare4opRmOQiSQyjUEtCYylqPt4GqA?usp=sharing). They must be respectively placed in the folders `data/` and `embeddings/`.
